In the game "The Invasion" players control a ship positioned at the bottom center of the screen. They can maneuver the ship horizontally using the arrow keys and shoot bullets by pressing the spacebar. At the start of the game, a fleet of aliens fills the sky, moving across the screen and gradually descending.

Players must aim to destroy the aliens by shooting at them with their ship's bullets. Whenever an alien is successfully hit, a new fleet swiftly replaces the defeated one, and this fresh fleet moves even faster than its predecessor. To increase the challenge, random bullets are fired from various locations on the screen, creating additional obstacles and requiring players to stay alert and dodge incoming projectiles.

However, players must be careful as they navigate through the alien onslaught. If an alien collides with the player's ship or manages to reach the bottom of the screen, one ship is lost. Players start with three ships, and if they lose all three, the game comes to an end, concluding their battle against the invading extraterrestrial forces.
